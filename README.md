# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Romualdo Sebany!

### About Me

I'm a passionate and proactive **Computer Science student** (currently in L2, transitioning to L3 in September 2025, with my Project de Fin d'Ã‰tudes planned for June 2026) at UniversitÃ© Saad Dahlab-Blida 1. My primary goal is to become an **expert in Artificial Intelligence** and contribute to building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems and create tangible value.

I'm constantly driven by curiosity and a desire to transform innovative ideas into concrete solutions, whether through complex algorithms or user-friendly interfaces.

### My Core Interests & Skills

My work revolves around:

* **Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning:** My deepest passion lies here. I'm focused on understanding data, developing intelligent algorithms, and applying them to practical scenarios.
    * **Concepts:** Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification), Data Analysis, Fraud Detection, Recommendation Systems.
    * **Tools/Libraries:** Python (Django, Flask), TensorFlow (basic understanding), Scikit-learn (implied from ML certs).
* **Web Development (Full-Stack):** I enjoy building complete web applications from front to back, ensuring robust functionality and intuitive user experiences.
    * **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS/Tailwind, JavaScript/TypeScript, React.js, Bootstrap.
    * **Backend:** Node.js/Express, PHP/Laravel, Python/Django/Flask, Java.
    * **Databases:** MySQL.
* **UI/UX Design:** My experience in graphic design helps me craft user-centric and aesthetically pleasing interfaces.
    * **Tools:** Figma, Adobe XD.
* **Version Control & Collaboration:** Git/GitHub, Agile/Trello.

### Key Projects

Here are some projects that showcase my expertise and passion:

* **[Application BonApp - DÃ©couverte de Restaurants](https://github.com/yourusername/BonApp-repo-link)** (Link to your GitHub repo if public)
    * **Technologies:** Laravel, TypeScript, React, Node.js/Express, MySQL, Heroku, (TensorFlow for recommendations).
    * **Description:** A comprehensive web application designed to help users discover restaurants in their environment. It features integration with geolocation services, food delivery, and a **personalized recommendation system** based on user preferences and reviews (leveraging collaborative filtering or machine learning techniques).
* **Projet de CompÃ©tition Bancaire - SystÃ¨me Intelligent**
    * **Technologies:** Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis (specific tools likely Python-based ML libraries).
    * **Description:** A winning team project focused on **AI-driven analysis and detection of fraudulent banking transactions**. My role involved developing the AI component for identifying anomalies and contributing to the overall system design.
* **[Book Review RESTful API](https://github.com/yourusername/BookReviewAPI-repo-link)** (Link to your GitHub repo if public)
    * **Technologies:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (example if used, specify actual DB).
    * **Description:** A robust RESTful API for managing book reviews, featuring secure JWT authentication, session management, and full CRUD operations for public and protected endpoints.

### Certifications & Learning

I believe in continuous learning and have completed or am pursuing certifications from top institutions:

* **Supervised ML: Regression and Classification** - Stanford University (Coursera)
* **DÃ©veloppement d'applications back-end avec Node.js et Express** - IBM (Coursera)
* **Data Manipulation in SQL** - DataCamp
* **CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science** - Harvard University (in progress)
